# Demo-Class-Based-Tools

* These files are intended to be run interactively to demonstrate how you might create a class-based PowerShell tool.
* The demo files are meant to show a progression using simple classes. At the end of the process is a basic module built around a class.
* The module is not intended for production use as currently written and is not necessarily a complete example of best scripting
practices.


These example files have *nothing* to do with creating a DSC class-based resource.
